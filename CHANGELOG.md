All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file, per [the Keep a Changelog standard](http://keepachangelog.com/).

## [Unreleased] - TBD

## [2.0.0] - 2021-08-24
This is now a composite Action, meaning that it runs directly on the GitHub Actions runner rather than spinning up its own container and is significantly faster.

### Added
- Set mime types on images in the SVN `assets` directory to prevent forced downloads on WordPress.org. Props [@nextgenthemes](https://github.com/nextgenthemes) via [action-wordpress-plugin-deploy#40](https://github.com/10up/action-wordpress-plugin-deploy/pull/40) and [@dinhtungdu](https://github.com/dinhtungdu) via [#21](https://github.com/10up/action-wordpress-plugin-asset-update/pull/21).
- Support for stable tag extraction from Markdown lists in README.md files. Props [@grappler](https://github.com/grappler) via [#25](https://github.com/10up/action-wordpress-plugin-asset-update/pull/25).
### Fixed
- Avoid a Debian image issue where the container could not be built. Props [@helen](https://github.com/helen) via [#30](https://github.com/10up/action-wordpress-plugin-asset-update/pull/30).

## [1.4.1] - 2020-03-12
### Fixed
- Ensure previously committed files that are later added to `.distignore` get deleted. Props [@pascalknecht](https://github.com/pascalknecht) via [#18](https://github.com/10up/action-wordpress-plugin-asset-update/pull/18).
- Escape filenames to avoid errors with filenames containing an `@` symbol. Props [@Gaya](https://github.com/Gaya) via [#18](https://github.com/10up/action-wordpress-plugin-asset-update/pull/18).
- Use `https` for WordPress.org URLs. Props [@dinhtungdu](https://github.com/dinhtungdu) via [#17](https://github.com/10up/action-wordpress-plugin-asset-update/pull/17).

## [1.3.0] - 2019-08-31
### Added
- Support for `.distignore` to align with the [deploy action](https://github.com/10up/action-wordpress-plugin-deploy/).
